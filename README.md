# A* Algorithm Implementation in Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the A* algorithm. A* is a popular pathfinding algorithm used in artificial intelligence and robotics to find the shortest path between two points in a graph. This implementation includes the use of a PriorityQueue for efficient searching and utilizes the matplotlib.pyplot and networkx libraries for graph visualization.

## Features
- A complete implementation of the A* algorithm in Python.
- Utilizes a PriorityQueue for efficient searching.
- Includes graph visualization using matplotlib.pyplot and networkx.

## Getting Started
To use this implementation, follow these steps: 

* Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MontMor4/A-Star-algorithm.git
  ```

* Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd A-Star-algorithm
  ```

* Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install networkx matplotlib
  ```

* Run the main script:
  ```bash
  python astar.py
  ```

## Usage
You can use this the function "astar" providing an Heuristic and a Graph, as well as the Start and your Goal


## Example
Shortest path betweeen 'Arad'(start) and 'Bucareste'(goal)
